# app_launch_demo

https://isaacroberts.app

Demo app - built in a day to show off my fast-to-market turnaround. This app is only one page, and has no backend, but is a proof of concept of a quickly-built app that still looks good. 

## Folders:

assets/:
Images, audio, video, etcetera. 

lib/:
Source code for the project

linux/:
(build folder)

test/:
Once we get to the mature development stage of your app, this is where the unit tests will go.

web/:
(build folder)

website/:
This is the frontend of the website, ready to be served by a flask server, or accessed via browser.
